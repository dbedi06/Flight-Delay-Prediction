This Data Science Project was made in the Winter 2025 quarter at the University of Washington. Kazuki Fujita, Xiangcheng Ji, and I worked on this project together as a team. 
This project uses a machine learning pipeline in Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy) to predict flight delays using 163k+ flight records and NOAA weather data,
We improved the recall of delayed flights from less than 1% to 62% using Random Forest with class rebalancing, demonstrating practical application of ML to real-world imbalanced datasets.
We built interactive visualizations in Plotly to communicate insights on airline performance, airport delays, and weather impacts to non-technical stakeholders.

Please make sure to download the file and then run all the cells inside the .ipynb notebook (some graphs/visualizations might not show unless you run the cells). 
Thank you so much for checking out this project, please feel free to give me some suggestions on how to improve it.
